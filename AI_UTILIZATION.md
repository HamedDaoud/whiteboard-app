# AI Utilization Statement

## Project: Whiteboard App – Retrieval Pipeline (Team Member 1)

As part of the competition requirements, this document outlines how **AI assistance** (OpenAI’s ChatGPT) was used in the development of the retrieval component of the Whiteboard App.

### Areas of AI Use

1. **Research Support**  
   - AI was consulted to compare potential data sources for retrieval.  
   - Based on this, the decision was made to adopt **Wikipedia** as the sole source for the MVP because it is the most general and comprehensive resource available, and it is the fastest to retrieve from compared to OERs or PDFs.  

2. **Automation of Code Generation**  
   - AI was used to generate code under my instructions.  
   - Example: the **`smoke.py`** script, which performs an end-to-end pipeline test to ensure there are no conflicts between modules, was fully generated with AI support.  
   - AI was also used for smaller tasks such as generating helper scripts, adding inline comments, and structuring certain functions.  

3. **Documentation**  
   - AI was used to draft and refine the **`README.md`** file, ensuring it is professional, concise, and tailored to the needs of the team members.  
   - This **AI Utilization Statement** itself was also generated with AI support.

### Summary
AI was leveraged as a **tool for research, code automation, and documentation drafting**, enabling faster and more structured development of the retrieval pipeline for the Whiteboard App.

### Instructions for Team Members
Each team member should add a new section under **Areas of AI Use** describing how they used AI during their part of the project. Keep the format consistent and professional.
